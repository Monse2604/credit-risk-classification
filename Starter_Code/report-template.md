# **📌 Credit Risk Analysis Report**

# **🔍 Overview**

This project analyzes credit risk using Logistic Regression, a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1). The dataset contains financial variables such as:

- Loan size

- Interest rate

- Borrower income

- Debt-to-income ratio

- Number of accounts

- Derogatory marks

- Total debt

The objective is to evaluate the model’s performance in classifying credit risk effectively.

## **🏗️ Machine Learning Process**

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Cleaned missing values and ensured numerical consistency.

Converted loan_status to an integer.

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2️⃣ Model Selection

Used Logistic Regression, a common classification algorithm.

Applied class balancing to handle the imbalance in high-risk loans.

3️⃣ Model Evaluation

Generated a confusion matrix and a classification report.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## **📈 Results**

Logistic Regression Model Performance

✅ Accuracy: 99%
✅ Precision:
- Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
- High-Risk Loans (1): 0.85✅ Recall:
- Healthy Loans (0): 0.99
- High-Risk Loans (1): 0.99✅ F1-Score:
- Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
- High-Risk Loans (1): 0.92

## **🔍 Summary & Recommendations**

📌 The logistic regression model performs exceptionally well with 99% accuracy. However:

- Healthy loans (0) are predicted almost perfectly (Precision: 1.00, Recall: 0.99).
- High-risk loans (1) have slightly lower precision (0.85), meaning some healthy loans were misclassified as risky.

🔹 Key Considerations

- If the goal is to reduce false positives (avoid rejecting healthy loans incorrectly), improving precision for high-risk loans is necessary.
- If identifying high-risk loans is critical, the model is suitable as recall is very high (0.99).
- To improve performance, consider exploring Random Forest or SVM models.

## **✅ Final Verdict**
💡 This model is a strong candidate for credit risk prediction, but fine-tuning may be required based on business priorities.
